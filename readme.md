# PSProfile

This is my work in progress PowerShell Profile repository

In this you will see use of a number of useful features that make my life in PowerShell much easier.


## MinProfile

Using PowerShell with my full profile takes something like 6 seconds to load, which isn't ideal

However, by using a min-profile initiation script I can load a smaller segment of my profile & then later on in the session load the rest of my profile as needed.



### TODO

Lots before release
