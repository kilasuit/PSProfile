## InspiredBy

Whilst the core inspiration to make this an open source project as opposed to continue it as a private script was a mixture of enabling others in their own research and development of a reusable PowerShell profile with the features required to allow multiple different needs as required.

This project has been inspired by many of my own personal projects for it's layout with many of those having been inspired by .NET projects
It has also been inspired by the following 

- Irritations with my own profile
- [Optimizing your $Profile - Steve Lee - PowerShell Team Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/optimizing-your-profile/)
- Other PowerShell team members profiles
- A session at SPS London 2015 - Jason Himmelstein
  - This session showed using a Key binding send in order to load modules and access services
  - This influenced me having a previous Read-Host implementation that well, see item 1 in this list
- Numerous introductory posts about the PowerShell profile over the years
- PowerShell Documentation 
- Discussions in the PowerShell Discord / Slack Community
- Discussions with former colleagues
- Discussions at [UK PowerShell User Groups](https://powershell.org.uk)
- Discussions at Conferences like PSConfAsia, PSConfEU, PSDayUK and others
- Discussions at Training events, whether community events or others
- Scripts/Modules and presentations by @IISResetMe & @nohwnd as well as plenty others around benchmarking PowerShell or .NET Code
 - Measure-Script & later PSProfiler & Profiler
